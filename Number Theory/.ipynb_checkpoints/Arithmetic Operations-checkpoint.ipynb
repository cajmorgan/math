    "# Arithmetic Operations\n",
    "## Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetical operations are the fundamental of mathematics which is used in someway or another in the majority of the fields. Addition and subtraction is pretty straight forward but there are some quirks especially with division. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Addition\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subtraction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "When we start to think about multiplication (& the inverse, division) things can get a bit more confusing when we really start to think deeply about the operations. One way to think of an expression like $5 * 4$ is to think that we multiply 5 ones by 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "$5 * 4 = (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) * 4 = (4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4) = 20$\n",
    "\n",
    "It's good to break it down like this because then we can think more logical about a problem like $5 * 0.4$. This problem we can either do it easy for us and think it like add 0.4 five times, which is completely correct. We can also think it like, convert every $1$ in $5$ to $0.4$ and add. \n",
    "\n",
    "$5 * 0.4 = (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) * 0.4 = (0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1) * 4 = (0.4 + 0.4 + 0.4 + 0.4 + 0.4) = 2$\n",
    "\n",
    "This might sound like overcomplicating things, but it's very handy when we start investigating division. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Division \n",
    "Division is very easy upon first sight, simply reverse the process of multiplication! Though, when you start thinking more deeply about division, confusion can start to happen. To explain normal division, we simply think in terms of **\"How many times can I subtract the divisor from the dividend?\"**\n",
    "This can be applied in multiplication as well, but it doesn't really make sense as multiplication *usually* expands to a larger magnitude (+-) (except when doing 0.x), division always moves closer to $0$ as long as the divisor is not $-1 < x < 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have 20 and we want to divide it by 4. We can have a counter on how many times we can possibly subtract the divisor 4 from the dividend 20. \n",
    "\n",
    "$20 - 4 = 16, q = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "$16 - 4 = 12, q = 2$\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "$0, q = 5$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also do this similarily to the multiplication example above, let's divide every 1 or sum of 1's by 4\n",
    "\n",
    "$(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 ... + 1) / 4 = (\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} \\frac{1}{4} \\frac{1}{4} ... + \\frac{1}{4}) = 5$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is good to know, because once we start to get remainders, we can use this. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we estimations with multiplication and we do a rounding, we will end up with a true remainder that will reflect the actual true value. So let's say we did $59 * 5 = 295$ but we rounded it up to 300, we could write it as $= 300p - 1r$. The product is 300 but we added 5 one time more than the true value, we rounded it up by 5, so we overestimate the number by adding $+ 5 * 1$ one too many times. This logic makes more sense within division, especially when division goes to $0$. Let's take $10 / 3$ as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can of course write it as $1/3 * 10$, i.e add $1/3$ ten times, but a better method is to use remainders. Let's subtract $3$ from $10$ as many times as possible and count.\n",
    "\n",
    "$10 - 3 = 7, q = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "$7 - 3 = 4, q = 2$\n",
    "\n",
    "$4 - 3 = 1, q = 3$\n",
    "\n",
    "We still have the value one left and we can't subtract 3 more times and if we do, we will overestimate the quotient, rounding up. Here we have a $1$ which we call the *remainder*. As you know before, division is the same as adding in this case $1/3$ ten times, so the remainder will simply be $r / d$ where $r = 1$ and $d = 3$. The answer is of course, $3 + \\frac{1}{3}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "What if we overestimate? The remainder will grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "$4 - 3 = 1, q = 3$\n",
    "\n",
    "$1 - 3 = -2, q = 4$\n",
    "\n",
    "$4 - \\frac{2}{3} = 4 - \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{3} = 3 + \\frac{1}{3} $\n",
    "\n",
    "It's thankfully the same number! \n",
    "\n",
    "We can always estimate division in this way and the balance between the quotient and remainder will be there. We can also divide parts using parts of the divisor as well, using estimations. This is what you do when using the *long division* - algorithm. In the long division algorithm, you can subtract more times than necessary, which results in larger estimations and larger remainders. Though, this can backfire and if the estimated divisor is too far off or too small, it won't converge, because you might never reach the property of the original divisor with an estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Long Division Explained\n",
    "Long division is just a nice method to write the things we did above, the method basically says, count how many times you can fit the divisor and subtract the divisor times the count from the dividend. In the above example with $10 / 3$, we first count that we can fit $3$ three times in 10, then we subtract and we have the remainder of $1$ left. We can of course do this with estimations as well and the remainder will be of larger magnitude in a positive or negative direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get the smallest absolute remainder, we want to try to fit the whole divisor every time, but if we need to simplify, in case we don't have a calculator, we actually don't have to fit the whole divisor the exact amount of times possible. Though as mentioned above, we can't estimate any number as the remainder will either grow to $\\pm\\infty$ or simply not converge. The general rule is that the estimation should be as close to the original divisor as possible, too far and it won't work. For example, we can start by fitting the divisor just $2$ times and we will end up with the same result but with extra steps. If we try to do a way to small estimation, for example $0.3$ it might take too many extra steps. \n"
