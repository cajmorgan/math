    "### Degrees & Radians\n",
    "Radians and degrees are the exact same thing, but in different forms. Radians is the natural version of it and degrees are the human invention (notice that 360 is very close to a full year) that makes it more acessible in certain scenarios. Probably the most important angle in mathematics are perpendicular, $90^\\circ$ which is the same thing as $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Radians are defined as the same length as the radius of a unit circle, 1. It's perfectly logical as that means we have $2\\pi$ radians for every circle regardless its size. $360^\\circ = 2\\pi$. Degrees are handy in certain situations, like classic geometry problems, but what about radians? Radians come up all over the place, especially in analysis. Something important to consider is that degrees never comes up natural in formulas in mathematics.\n",

    "### Using Trigonometry to prove $\\angle\\alpha+\\angle\\beta+\\angle\\gamma = 180^{\\circ}$ \n",
    "This is one Trigonometry proof for prooving that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always $180^{\\circ}$. This proof can be directly written out from a triangle drawing through reasoning, but we will do it through algebra.\n",

    "This might be pretty obvious if we just visualize a circle and some basics trigonometry rules, but the point here is to visualize this with a triangle and how that can prove the statement. \n",

    "In a normal period of 360$^{\\circ}$, how can you tell how many full rotations something has already spun, without seeing it first? You are basically back to where you started, and $\\arcsin(0)$ is actually equal to both 180$^{\\circ}$ and 0$^{\\circ}$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If we zoom out to any triangle, we can easily prove this because the same steps will always be applicable, no matter how the triangle looks like. The statement will always be true if sin(180$^{\\circ}$) = 0 and drawing a rectangle in a similar fashion and a line perpendicular to the triangle's height will also **always** be possible, but these things can of course be proven separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to summarize, we can use the above derivation to prove some equalities with angles through the sine function and if we add them up by the derivation, the sine of them will always equal 0 and the arcsine, 0$^{\\circ}$ or 180$^{\\circ}$ and as we know that the sum of the natural angles are not 0$^{\\circ}$, it must be 180$^{\\circ}$.
