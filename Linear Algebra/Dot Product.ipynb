    "# Dot Product\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vectors\n",
    "The dot product between two vectors always produce a scalar, a single number. It's possible to view the dot product of two vectors in many different ways. One way is so called **projection** and another one simply a 1x2 matrix transformation. .......\n",
    "\n",
    "The dot product of a vector $v$ with itself simply is the length of it squared, in n-dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### $v\\cdot v = ||v||^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "Let's say $v = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "           v_1 \\\\\n",
    "           v_2 \\\\\n",
    "           v_3 \\\\\n",
    "         \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "         \n",
    "$v \\cdot v = $\n",
    "\n",
    "$v_1^2 + v_2^2+v_3^2 = $\n",
    "where $\\sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2}$ is the base of the triangle with the height $\\sqrt{v_3^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "With the pythagorean theorem, \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sqrt{\\sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2}^2 + \\sqrt{v_3^2}^2} =  $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\sqrt{{v_1^2 + v_2^2} + {v_3^2}} = ||v||$\n",
    "\n",
    "${v_1^2 + v_2^2} + {v_3^2} = ||v||^2$ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unit Vectors\n",
    "A unit vector $u$ is a vector where its length equals 1. If you divide a vector by it's length, the length should equal one, correct? Therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{v}{||v||} = u$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which in words means that $u$ is the unit vector corresponding to $v$. If $v$ was a unit vector, it would be $u$. In other words $u$ has the same direction as $v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trigonometry\n",
    "We know that $\\sin\\theta$ & $\\cos\\theta\\$ gives us coordinates in a unit circle, so why can't we use them as inputs in a vector? We can and it also follows the above rules because \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sin(\\theta)^2 + \\cos(\\theta)^2 = 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Right Angles\n",
    "The dot product of perpendicular vectors are always 0, why?\n",
    "\n",
    "$v \\cdot v = ||v||^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Pythagoras theorem is defined for right angle triangles.\n",
    "\n",
    "With two perpendicular vectors $v$ & $w$ the difference will always be the hypotenuse, vector $c = v - w$. Therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "$||v||^2 + ||w||^2 = ||c||^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "$v \\cdot v + w \\cdot w = c \\cdot c = $\n",
    "\n",
    "$v_1^2 + v_2^2 + w_1^2 + w_2^2 = c_1^2 + c_2^2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Substitue $c$\n",
    "\n",
    "$v_1^2 + v_2^2 + w_1^2 + w_2^2 = (v_1-w_1)^2 + (v_2-w_2)^2 = $\n",
    "\n",
    "$v_1^2 + v_2^2 + w_1^2 + w_2^2 = v_1^2-2v_1w_1+w_1^2 + v_2^2-2v_2w_2+w_2^2 = $\n",
    "\n",
    "$0 = -2v_1w_1 - 2v_2w_2 = $\n",
    "\n",
    "$0 = v_1w_1 + v_2w_2 =  $\n",
    "\n",
    "$0 = v \\cdot w$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The angle between two vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "At angle $\\theta$ two unit vectors $u \\cdot U = \\cos\\theta$\n",
    "Therefore, to find $\\cos\\theta$ between any vector $v$ & $w$, the following formula is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{v \\cdot w}{||v||||w||}$\n",
    "Which basically means, convert $v$ to $u$ by dividing itself by its length, do the same with $w$ and take their dot products.\n",
    "\n",
    "This works because, lets say we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$v = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "           \\cos(\\alpha) \\\\\n",
    "           \\sin(\\alpha) \\\\\n",
    "     \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "$w = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "           \\cos(\\beta) \\\\\n",
    "           \\sin(\\beta) \\\\\n",
    "     \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "     \n",
    "Where the angle between them is $\\theta = \\beta - \\alpha$\n",
    "\n",
    "$v \\cdot w = $\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\cos(\\alpha)\\cos(\\beta) + \\sin(\\alpha)\\sin(\\beta) = $\n",
    "\n",
    "By using cosine addition formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\cos(\\alpha - \\beta) = \\cos(\\theta)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inequalities\n",
    "Since cosine never exceeds 1 or below -1, according to the formula \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{v \\cdot w}{||v||\\,||w||} \\le 1 $\n",
    "\n",
    "$v \\cdot w \\le||v||\\,||w||$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above statement is called Schwarz Inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this we can also prove the Triangle Inequality:\n",
    "\n",
    "$||v + w|| \\le ||v|| + ||w||$\n",
    "\n",
    "This basically says, the length of the diagonal (the sum of the two vectors) is less or equals to the sum of the lengths of the vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider $(v+w)^2 = v^2 + 2vw + w^2 = ||v||^2 + 2vw + ||w||^2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then consider $(||v|| + ||w||)^2 = ||v||^2 + 2||v||\\,||w|| + ||w||^2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then because from the Schwarz Inequality, $2vw \\le 2||v||\\,||w||$\n",
    "\n",
    "It means that the following must be true:\n",
    "\n",
    "$||v||^2 + 2vw + ||w||^2 \\le ||v||^2 + 2||v||\\,||w|| + ||w||^2 =$\n",
    "\n",
