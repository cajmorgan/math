    "# Dot Product\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vectors\n",
    "The dot product between two vectors always produce a scalar, a single number. It's possible to view the dot product of two vectors in many different ways. One way is so called **projection** and another one simply a matrix transformation $v^{T}w$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Explaination of $v \\cdot w$\n",
    "The dot product can seem a bit mysterious at first sight and often you will find something stated like: $v \\cdot w = ||v||\\,||w||cos(\\theta)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the length of $v$ times the length of $w$ multiplied by the angle $\\theta$ between them. This made no sense to me the first time I saw it and now I will explain why this is. Some people try to explain this a projection onto the other vector, but I would argue that is not completely correct as the result is simply on the number line, i.e the result is in the form of $(x, 0)$. The dot product is not something *natural* in anyway, it's simply an operation that does something useful required in many different scenarios, multiplying two similar parts and adding them together. In the context of a vector, it's the respectively components multiplied together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why would you even want to use the dot product of two vectors? Two examples is vector similarity and vector length of itself. A higher number indicates more similar than a lower. When it's $0$ that indicates it's a 90 degree angle. \n",
    "\n",
    "To explain this formula, let's use an example of:\n",
    "\n",
    "$v = (2, 2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$w = (4, 2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "In polar form those would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$v = \\sqrt{8}(cos(45^{\\circ}), sin(45^{\\circ}))$\n",
    "\n",
    "$w = \\sqrt{20}(cos(26.56^{\\circ}), sin(26.56^{\\circ}))$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we now take the dot products of $v \\cdot w$ we will get\n",
    "\n",
    "$c \\cdot w = \\sqrt{20}\\sqrt{8}(cos(45^{\\circ})cos(26.56^{\\circ}) + sin(45^{\\circ})sin(26.56^{\\circ}))$\n",
    "\n",
    "$c \\cdot w = \\sqrt{20}\\sqrt{8}(cos(45^{\\circ} - 26.56^{\\circ}))$\n",
    "\n",
    "Above we can clearly see $v \\cdot w = ||v||\\,||w||cos(\\theta)$ where $\\theta$ is the angle between the vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Length\n",
    "\n",
    "The dot product of a vector $v$ with itself simply is the length of it squared, in n-dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### $v\\cdot v = ||v||^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "Let's say $v = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "           v_1 \\\\\n",
    "           v_2 \\\\\n",
    "           v_3 \\\\\n",
    "         \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "         \n",
    "$v \\cdot v = $\n",
    "\n",
    "$v_1^2 + v_2^2+v_3^2 = $\n",
    "where $\\sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2}$ is the base of the triangle with the height $\\sqrt{v_3^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "With the pythagorean theorem, \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sqrt{\\sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2}^2 + \\sqrt{v_3^2}^2} =  $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\sqrt{{v_1^2 + v_2^2} + {v_3^2}} = ||v||$\n",
    "\n",
    "${v_1^2 + v_2^2} + {v_3^2} = ||v||^2$ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unit Vectors\n",
    "A unit vector $u$ is a vector where its length equals 1. If you divide a vector by it's length, the length should equal one, correct? Therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{v}{||v||} = u$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which in words means that $u$ is the unit vector corresponding to $v$. If $v$ was a unit vector, it would be $u$. In other words $u$ has the same direction as $v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trigonometry\n",
    "We know that $\\sin\\theta$ & $\\cos\\theta\\$ gives us coordinates in a unit circle, so why can't we use them as inputs in a vector? We can and it also follows the above rules because \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sin(\\theta)^2 + \\cos(\\theta)^2 = 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Right Angles\n",
    "The dot product of perpendicular vectors are always 0, why?\n",
    "\n",
    "$v \\cdot v = ||v||^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Pythagoras theorem is defined for right angle triangles.\n",
    "\n",
    "With two perpendicular vectors $v$ & $w$ the difference will always be the hypotenuse, vector $c = v - w$. Therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "$||v||^2 + ||w||^2 = ||c||^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "$v \\cdot v + w \\cdot w = c \\cdot c = $\n",
    "\n",
    "$v_1^2 + v_2^2 + w_1^2 + w_2^2 = c_1^2 + c_2^2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Substitue $c$\n",
    "\n",
    "$v_1^2 + v_2^2 + w_1^2 + w_2^2 = (v_1-w_1)^2 + (v_2-w_2)^2 = $\n",
    "\n",
    "$v_1^2 + v_2^2 + w_1^2 + w_2^2 = v_1^2-2v_1w_1+w_1^2 + v_2^2-2v_2w_2+w_2^2 = $\n",
    "\n",
    "$0 = -2v_1w_1 - 2v_2w_2 = $\n",
    "\n",
    "$0 = v_1w_1 + v_2w_2 =  $\n",
    "\n",
    "$0 = v \\cdot w$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The angle between two vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "At angle $\\theta$ two unit vectors $u \\cdot U = \\cos\\theta$\n",
    "Therefore, to find $\\cos\\theta$ between any vector $v$ & $w$, the following formula is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{v \\cdot w}{||v||||w||} = cos(\\theta)$\n",
    "Which basically means, convert $v$ to $u$ by dividing itself by its length, do the same with $w$ and take their dot products.\n",
    "\n",
    "This works because, lets say we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$v = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "           \\cos(\\alpha) \\\\\n",
    "           \\sin(\\alpha) \\\\\n",
    "     \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "$w = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "           \\cos(\\beta) \\\\\n",
    "           \\sin(\\beta) \\\\\n",
    "     \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "     \n",
    "Where the angle between them is $\\theta = \\beta - \\alpha$\n",
    "\n",
    "$v \\cdot w = $\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\cos(\\alpha)\\cos(\\beta) + \\sin(\\alpha)\\sin(\\beta) = $\n",
    "\n",
    "By using cosine addition formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\cos(\\alpha - \\beta) = \\cos(\\theta)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Important, notice the relationship: $v \\cdot w = ||v||\\,||w||cos(\\theta)$ \n",
    "which actually explains what the dot product really is. It's the length of both vectors multiplied together in the direction of the angle $\\theta$. This is the so called projection, where the vectors gets projected on the same line and their combined magnitude is the resulting scalar value. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use this in a clever way together with Law of Cosine to get out the difference of the vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$||v - w||^2 = v^2 + w^2 - 2||v||\\,||w||cos(\\theta) = $\n",
    "\n",
    "$||v - w||^2 = v^2 + w^2 - v \\cdot w$\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be handy when solving certain type of problems, like the kNN algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inequalities\n",
    "Since cosine never exceeds 1 or below -1, according to the formula \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{v \\cdot w}{||v||\\,||w||} \\le 1 $\n",
    "\n",
    "$v \\cdot w \\le||v||\\,||w||$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above statement is called Schwarz Inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this we can also prove the Triangle Inequality:\n",
    "\n",
    "$||v + w|| \\le ||v|| + ||w||$\n",
    "\n",
    "This basically says, the length of the diagonal (the sum of the two vectors) is less or equals to the sum of the lengths of the vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider $(v+w)^2 = v^2 + 2vw + w^2 = ||v||^2 + 2vw + ||w||^2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then consider $(||v|| + ||w||)^2 = ||v||^2 + 2||v||\\,||w|| + ||w||^2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then because from the Schwarz Inequality, $2vw \\le 2||v||\\,||w||$\n",
    "\n",
    "It means that the following must be true:\n",
    "\n",
    "$||v||^2 + 2vw + ||w||^2 \\le ||v||^2 + 2||v||\\,||w|| + ||w||^2 =$\n",
    "\n",
    "$||v + w||^2 \\le (||v|| + ||w||)^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "$||v + w|| \\le ||v|| + ||w||$"
