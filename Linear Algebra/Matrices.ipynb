    "Matrices are a set of very handy notations in Mathematics and are a core concept in Linear Algebra. Matrices can be viewed in many different ways, just a spreadsheet of numbers, columns of vectors, or the transformations, where every column represent where every unit vector will end up after applying the transformation to a vector (dot product). For example, in 2x2 matrix, the 2 columns can be viewed as the coordinates where the unit vectors $\\hat{i}$ (X-axis) and unit vector $\\hat{j}$ (Y-axis) ends up (from (1, 0) & (0, 1). \n",
