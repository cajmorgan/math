    "## Vector Space\n",
    "Vector spaces are every point in $R^n$ that the vector with 2 components exists. A vector in $R^2$ will have 2 components, always, even if it's zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "$V = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "        a \\\\\n",
    "        b\n",

    "    $\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector space is a group and needs to follow a set of rules with multiplication and addition, that makes sense and aren't contradictory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Subspace\n",
    "A subspace is a space within a vector space that follows certain rules. The most important and obvious one is that regardless of allowed operations that are applied (addition & multiplication in this case), the vector will stay in that subspace. In $R^2$Â there are 3 subspaces:\n",
    "- All of $R^2$\n",
    "- Any line through the origin, the reason for this is if you pick a vector, you can scale it in any direction and also add other vectors in that same space (the line!) and it will only stay in that space!\n",
    "- The zero vector. You can multiply anything with the zero vector and add those together and it's still in that subspace."
