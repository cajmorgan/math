    "Matrices are a set of very handy notations in Mathematics and are a core concept in Linear Algebra. Matrices can be viewed in many different ways, just a spreadsheet of numbers, columns of vectors, or the transformations, where every column represent where every unit vector will end up after applying the transformation to a vector (dot product). For example, in 2x2 matrix, the 2 columns can be viewed as the coordinates where the unit vectors $\\hat{i}$ (X-axis) and unit vector $\\hat{j}$ (Y-axis) ends up (from (1, 0) & (0, 1). \n",

    "**Note that to be able to apply a matrix to another entity, the number of rows of the matrix needs to equal the number of columns of the target**\n",

    "### Matrix inversion $Ax = b, x = A^{-1}bÂ $\n",
    "The inversion of a matrix is basically what matrix times the result $b$ of the first matrix transformation (linear combination) $Ax$ equals to $x$, i.e how to find the vector x if you have matrix A and the result b. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not all matrices are invertible, but when they are, finding the inversion of a matrix is usually done with Gaussian Elimination. \n",

    "#### Row Picture\n",
    "The row picture is basically what we learn from the normal Algebra class, where we view every row of the matrix as the equation, f.e in 2 dimensions, x + y = 3 and draw the line that corresponds to that and the next row. The solution will be were those objects meet.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Column Picture\n",
    "The column picture on the other hand is when we view the matrix as the vectors every column represents and draw the solution as a **linear combination**."
