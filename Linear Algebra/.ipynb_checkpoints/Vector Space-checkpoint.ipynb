    "## Vector Space\n",
    "Vector spaces are every point in $R^n$ that the vector with 2 components exists. A vector in $R^2$ will have 2 components, always, even if it's zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "$V = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "        a \\\\\n",
    "        b\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "    $\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector space is a group and needs to follow a set of rules with multiplication and addition, that makes sense and aren't contradictory. To form a vector space, you will always need the **ZERO** vector. Also, the combinations of the vectors in that subspace need to be inside that subspace as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Subspace\n",
    "A subspace is a space within a vector space that follows certain rules. The most important and obvious one is that regardless of allowed operations that are applied (addition & multiplication in this case), the vector will stay in that subspace. In $R^2$ there are 3 subspaces:\n",
    "- All of $R^2$\n",
    "- Any line through the origin, the reason for this is if you pick a vector, you can scale it in any direction and also add other vectors in that same space (the line!) and it will only stay in that space!\n",
    "- The zero vector. You can multiply anything with the zero vector and add those together and it's still in that subspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important to consider here is that the **result stays in the space**. $cx$ needs to stay in the space and $cx + dy$ as well, i.e all linear combinations of the set of vectors stay in the same space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Column Space\n",
    "Is the space that is created by the columns of a matrix. For a concrete definition, it's the space that **consists of all linear combinations of the columns of $Ax$**. I.e the column space is *spanned* by the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important aspect of the column space is the following: When can we solve $Ax = b?$ -> When b is in the column space of A!\n",
    "Any linear combination of the columns of one space, will stay in that space as declared above. Even if we have more equations than unknown, we can solve b when it's part of the **column space**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Row Space\n",
    "The row space of a matrix is the subspace of $R^n$ spanned by the rows, where n is the number of columns. Just think of those vectors as the columns but transposed, i.e as the column space but as row vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Null Space\n",
    "The nullspace in $Ax = b$ is the vector $x$ when b is the zero vector. With a good usual invertible matrix with independent vectors the only vector that can satisfy this is the zero vector, when $x = 0$. In other cases, f.e when columns are dependent, there exists more vectors that's part of the null space, where $A$ transform $x$ into $0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To find the null space we need $Ax = 0$ where $A$ is not an invertible matrix, f.e a matrix that's not square. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Why is nullspace important?](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/988463/1108764)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rank\n",
    "When doing normal elimination of a non-invertible matrix solving for 0, you will end up with zeros on some of the normal pivot. Those columns are called free columns as they contain free variables, which means that you can choose any variable for those. The columns that contains the \"pivots\" make up the rank of the matrix. If there are 2 pivots and 3 free columns, it's a rank 2 matrix with 3 free variables. The number of free variables are n columns minus the rank, $n - r = f$\n",
    "\n",
    "Though, to find all solutions, it's important to consider that the null space, as a space, needs to follow the axioms. Therefore, all combinations of vectors in the null space stays in the null space. To find all solutions we can plug in a combinations of 1s and 0s because the combinations of those will eventually produce all solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The rank is the 'dimension' of the column space & row space, by dimension I mean what is produced, f.e a plane in 3d space. The number of free columns is the dimension of the null space.**\n",
    "\n",
    "$A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "        1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "        0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "        0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "        0 & 0 & 0\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "    $\n",
    "\n",
    "The rank of A is 2 (pivots) and the number of free variables are 1 (one special solution). The column space produces a 2d plane in 4 dimensions (the vectors are 4d). The row space produces a 2d plane in 3 dimensions. The nullspace is a line (1d) $c(-1, -1, 1)$ and is the solution to Ax = 0\\.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Row Echelon Form and Reduced\n",
    "If at the same time there are only zeros below those leading entries in every column where the pivots would be in an invertible matrix, we are in so called **Row Echelon Form**. If we eliminate the components in the same columns above the pivots as well, we would reach **Reduced Row Echelon Form**. This form is especially good because it will be easy to find all the solutions to $Rx = 0$ easily. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at this rank 2 matrix with 1 column of free variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "$R = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "        1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "        0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "        0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "        0 & 0 & 0\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "    $\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at this in as a \"block\" matrix instead, where I is two columns and F is one (because of the rank), how would we turn this to zero by multiplication?\n",
    "$R = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "        I & F \\\\\n",
    "        0 & 0  \\\\\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "    $\n",

    "    -F \\\\ \n",
    "    I\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "    $\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy, simplistic and beautiful... The solutions to the reduced row echelon form is simply the the identity matrix time the negative of the free columns and add, i.e take their dot product. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The complete solution Ax = b\n",
    "There exists a solution to Ax = b exactly when b is in the column space of A. In words, the complete solution is a particular x that produces the correct b + the combination of all solutions from the nullspace (or any general vector from $N$)\n",
    "The complete solution can be found in a number of steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set all free variables to 0 to find a particular solution $x_p$\n",
    "2. Find the special solutions in the nullspace, $ s_n \\in N$\n",
    "3. The complete solution is $x_p + s_n$ because $As_n = 0$ and $Ax_p = b \\rightarrow 0 + b = b$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Full Column Rank\n",
    "If $r = n$, **full column rank** how many solutions are there? The nullspace must be zero as there is a pivot for every column so either it exists one solution or zero, depending on b and how the equations looks like. To demonstrate an example when it **won't** have solution, let's pick a matrix that's a bit tall and find it's condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$A = \\begin{bmatrix} \n",
    "    1 & 0 \\\\\n",

    "    b_1 \\\\\n",
    "    b_2 \\\\\n",
    "    b_3 - b_2\n",
    "  \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "This particular example will **only** have a solution when $b_3 - b_2 = 0$, no other way!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Full Row Rank\n",
    "Full Row Rank is when there exists a pivot for every row. This matrix can either be square or rectangular on the width: $rows \\leq columns $ When the row is full rank, there always exists a solution to $Ax = b$ because their will never be a row with just zeros, hence we won't have a specific solveable condition for $b$. This means that it exists infinitely $\\infty$ many solutions in this case. There will be $n - r$ free variables and the nullspace can of course have special solutions which will combine into the complete solution $x_p + x_{sn}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Full Rank\n",
    "Is a square matrix that will always have a **unique solution** and is invertible, this is when $r = m = n$, the rank is the same as the columns and the rows, which also means that both columns and rows are linearly independent. The nullspace is just the 0 vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### No Full Rank\n",
    "When $r < m, r < n$. It can have pivots still but it can only have either $0$ or $\\infty$ many solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basis\n",
    "A basis is a bunch of vectors that are independent and span the space. By spanning the space, their combinations take up the whole space they are in. For example in 2 dimensions, the vetors $(1, 0)$ & $(0, 1)$ forms a basis for that space. \n",
    "\n",
    "When something *spans* the space, it means that all the combination takes up all of that space. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the vectors don't have to span the space of the same dimensions, f.e in three dimensions you can find two independent vectors, that do satisfy the two properties for a basis and their combinations will create a plane in $R^3$. A basis is not necessarily unique for a space, it can actually be infinitily many.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors that satisfy the following properties form a basis of a space (or subspace):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. They are independent\n",
    "2. They span their space (subspace or wholespace) \n",
    "\n",
    "**The number of vectors in a basis is the dimension of that space they reside in.** \n",
    "rank(A) = no. pivot columns = the dimension of the column space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A \"vector\" space\n",
    "A vector can take many forms, it can take the form of a matrix, a function or other type of mathematical \"objects\". There are 3 fundamental properties a vector space must have and some other rules that those obeys.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The zero vector must exist in the space, in other words the vector needs to pass through the origin\n",
    "- The product of multiplying the vector by any scalar should still stay in the same space\n",
    "- Taking the linear combinations of 2 or more vectors inside that space should still stay in the same space\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, this means that the \"space\" needs to be closed in order to be classified as a space. The first mentioned property can be derived from the second, as multiplying a vector by 0 should in normal circumstances turn it into the \"zero vector\" and hence the zero vector need to exist in space if property 2 is correct, hence property 2 is a criteria for itself and the zero vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it more detailed, there are 8 conditions/axioms to define a vector space:\n",
    "1. x + y = y + x\n",
    "2. x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z\n",
    "3. $\\forall{x}, \\exists!{0} \\mid x + 0 = x $\n",
    "4. $\\forall{x}, \\exists!{-x} \\mid x + (-x) = 0$ \n",
    "5. $1 \\times x = x$\n",
    "6. $(c_1c_2)x = c_1(c_2x)$\n",
    "7. $x(x + y) = cx + cy$\n",
    "8. $(c_1 + c_2)x = c_1x + c_2x$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matrix Space\n",
    "To make a vector space abstract, let's give an example of a vector space consiting o matrices, which sounds a bit contraproductive, but is valid. The main rules that need to follow is, the linear combinations of the matrices need to stay in the space and there is a zero vector. We should also be able to find a basis for this space, let's find the basis for a matrix 2x2 matrix.  \n",

If we put them inside a *special* matrix $M$ we can view the first two as pivot vectors and the third as a free vector. Let's solve $Mx = 0$ with the same methods and we find that the vector $(-1, -1, 1)$ is the special solution. The only other way to get zero is of course with the zero vector, but this means that the special solution vector only spans $\\mathbb{R}^1$, but resides in $\\mathbb{R}^3$!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function Space\n",
    "A space can also be a set of functions and viewed as \"vectors\". Let's say we have the subspace **All functions that equal zero**. That is only a subspace if all the linear combinations of those functions still is in the space, 0. At the moment I can only think of one function with that criteria, $cf(x) = 0, cf(x) = c(1 - 1)$. This function space *seems* to be 1 dimensional, because there exists only one independent basis as shown above, **0 is not a basis**. The function $f(x)$ and the combination of $f(x)$ can produce probably all functions that goes to 0 as $c$ can be anything.\n",
