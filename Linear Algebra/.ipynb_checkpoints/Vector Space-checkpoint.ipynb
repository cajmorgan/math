    "## Vector Space\n",
    "Vector spaces are every point in $R^n$ that the vector with 2 components exists. A vector in $R^2$ will have 2 components, always, even if it's zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "$V = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "        a \\\\\n",
    "        b\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "    $\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector space is a group and needs to follow a set of rules with multiplication and addition, that makes sense and aren't contradictory. To form a vector space, you will always need the **ZERO** vector. Also, the combinations of the vectors in that subspace need to be inside that subspace as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Subspace\n",
    "A subspace is a space within a vector space that follows certain rules. The most important and obvious one is that regardless of allowed operations that are applied (addition & multiplication in this case), the vector will stay in that subspace. In $R^2$ there are 3 subspaces:\n",
    "- All of $R^2$\n",
    "- Any line through the origin, the reason for this is if you pick a vector, you can scale it in any direction and also add other vectors in that same space (the line!) and it will only stay in that space!\n",
    "- The zero vector. You can multiply anything with the zero vector and add those together and it's still in that subspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important to consider here is that the **result stays in the space**. $cx$ needs to stay in the space and $cx + dy$ as well, i.e all linear combinations of the set of vectors stay in the same space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Column Space\n",
    "Is the space that is created by the columns of a matrix. A important aspect of the column space is the following: When can we solve $Ax = b?$ -> When b is in the column space of A!\n",
    "Any linear combination of the columns of one space, will stay in that space as declared above. Even if we have more equations than unknown, we can solve b when it's part of the **column space**. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A \"vector\" space\n",
    "A vector can take many forms, it can take the form of a matrix, a function or other type of mathematical \"objects\". There are 3 fundamental properties a vector space must have and some other rules that those obeys.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The zero vector must exist in the space, in other words the vector needs to pass through the origin\n",
    "- The product of multiplying the vector by any scalar should still stay in the same space\n",
    "- Taking the linear combinations of 2 or more vectors inside that space should still stay in the same space\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, this means that the \"space\" needs to be closed in order to be classified as a space. The first mentioned property can be derived from the second, as multiplying a vector by 0 should in normal circumstances turn it into the \"zero vector\" and hence the zero vector need to exist in space if property 2 is correct, hence property 2 is a criteria for itself and the zero vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make it more detailed, there are 8 conditions/axioms to define a vector space:\n",
    "1. x + y = y + x\n",
    "2. x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z\n",
    "3. $\\forall{x}, \\exists!{0} \\mid x + 0 = x $\n",
    "4. $\\forall{x}, \\exists!{-x} \\mid x + (-x) = 0$ \n",
    "5. $1 \\times x = x$\n",
    "6. $(c_1c_2)x = c_1(c_2x)$\n",
    "7. $x(x + y) = cx + cy$\n",
    "8. $(c_1 + c_2)x = c_1x + c_2x$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Null Space\n",
    "The nullspace in $Ax = b$ is the vector $x$ when b is the zero vector. With a good usual invertible matrix with independent vectors the only vector that can satisfy this is the zero vector, when $x = 0$. In other cases, f.e when columns are dependent, there exists more vectors that's part of the null space, where $A$ transform $x$ into $0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To find the null space we need $Ax = 0$ where $A$ is not an invertible matrix, f.e a matrix that's not square. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Why is nullspace important?](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/988463/1108764)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rank\n",
    "When doing normal elimination of a non-invertible matrix solving for 0, you will end up with zeros on some of the normal pivot. Those columns are called free columns as they contain free variables, which means that you can choose any variable for those. The columns that contains the \"pivots\" make up the rank of the matrix. If there are 2 pivots and 3 free columns, it's a rank 2 matrix with 3 free variables. The number of free variables are n columns minus the rank, $n - r = f$\n",
    "\n",
    "Though, to find all solutions, it's important to consider that the null space, as a space, needs to follow the axioms. Therefore, all combinations of vectors in the null space stays in the null space. To find all solutions we can plug in a combinations of 1s and 0s because the combinations of those will eventually produce all solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The rank is the 'dimension' of the column space & row space, by dimension I mean what is produced, f.e a plane in 3d space. The number of free columns is the dimension of the null space.**\n",
    "\n",
    "$A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "        1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "        0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "        0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "        0 & 0 & 0\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "    $\n",
    "\n",
    "The rank of A is 2 (pivots) and the number of free variables are 1 (one special solution). The column space produces a 2d plane in 4 dimensions (the vectors are 4d). The row space produces a 2d plane in 3 dimensions. The nullspace is a line (1d) $c(-1, -1, 1)$ and is the solution to Ax = 0\\.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Row Echelon Form and Reduced\n",
    "If at the same time there are only zeros below those leading entries in every column where the pivots would be in an invertible matrix, we are in so called **Row Echelon Form**. If we eliminate the components in the same columns above the pivots as well, we would reach **Reduced Row Echelon Form**. This form is especially good because it will be easy to find all the solutions to $Rx = 0$ easily. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at this rank 2 matrix with 1 column of free variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "$R = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "        1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "        0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "        0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "        0 & 0 & 0\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "    $\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at this in as a \"block\" matrix instead, where I is two columns and F is one (because of the rank), how would we turn this to zero by multiplication?\n",
    "$R = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "        I & F \\\\\n",
    "        0 & 0  \\\\\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "    $\n",
    "\n",
    "0 = $R = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "        I & F \\\\\n",
    "        0 & 0  \\\\\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "    \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "    -F \\\\ \n",
    "    I\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "    $\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy, simplistic and beautiful... The solutions to the reduced row echelon form is simply the the identity matrix time the negative of the free columns and add, i.e take their dot product. "
