    "A vector resides in n dimensions and that is dictated by how many rows that vector contains. Every vector is always multiplied by a single value called a *scalar* and is shown in the example below as $c$.\n",

    "In 3 dimensions, an equation as $x + y = b$ will actually fill a plane, why is that? Well when we have 3 axis, there is always a hidden $z$ such as $x + y + 0z = b$, hence any z is a solution to that equation and the that's a plane that's perpendicular to the xy axis. An example below where x + y + 0z = 0, the plane goes through the origin because when x = 0, y = 0 and z can be anything. \n",

An easy thinking here is basically, in 2d space, can you ever produce a 3d vector? No, it's not possible, although the opposite is true, but it won't be really two dimensional, it will just fill a 2 dimensional space in 3 dimensional, so called a plane. \n"
