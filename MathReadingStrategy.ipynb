    "The purpose of this strategy is to learn Mathematics in a iterative process to memorize and effectivize \n",
    "the learning as much as possible. The purpose of this strategy is not that the learning process \n",
    "should be any slower than reading the book in one turn, quite the opposite, it's purpose is to make it much easier \n",
    "to understand the material, through repetitive exposure. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a past musician, this method is inspired from an effective method to memorize long and complex pieces of music. \n",
    "In summary the logic behind that process is that you should learn a piece and in a short amount of time and forget it knowingly.\n",
    "The idea is that when you re-learn the piece, it will take even longer to forget it once again, and after around 3-4 iterations,\n",
    "most of the piece will stick for a very long time, or at least a much longer time than initially.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Mathematics there is so much to learn and I found after studying pretty intensively\n",
    "that it's too easy to forget important aspects, especially when studying in a quick tempo.\n",
    "Therefore this is a strategy I've created with the inspiration from other sources on the web, \n",
    "as a trial to help my study, based on the hypothesis of iterative memorization. \n"

If you are like me, the hardest part with this is to not get hanged up on details. The mindset you need to have here is that it's perfectly OK to not understand what's going on. This process should not take more than a week in a normal sized book, most of the times, 2-3 days in study time.

Here it's important to focus on the aspects that you didn't get the first time and to repeat some of the important keywords and areas. This is a good time to do at least 10 more exercises per chapter and try the harder ones that might involve proving things. Re-read the proofs and try understand it on a deeper level. It's perfectly reasonable you spend a long time per page, especially if that page contains important information.\n",
