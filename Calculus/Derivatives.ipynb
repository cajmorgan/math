    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chain Rule\n",
    "When using the chain rule, as an example it's good to consider a function that gets an effect from another function, just like a chain of events. F.e let's say we have the function $V(r)$ that depends on the variable $r$, the radius. Let's say that $r$ depends on time in seconds $r(t)$. The most important thing here to understand is that the variable or function $r$ is dependent or independent completely depending on **context**. \n",
    "\n",
    "What would the derivative of $V(r)$ be? Well, it will just be $\\frac{dV}{dr}$, simple as usual, but what would the derivative of $V(t) = V(r(t))$ be? $V(t)$ first depends on $r$ which depends on $t$, this means that we can't use derive it as usual, here we need the chain rule, which states:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{dV}{dr} \\times \\frac{dr}{dt}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The nice thing about the chain rule is that the ratio (which some say you shouldn't treat as a ratio) cancels out nicely. \n",

    "## Implicit and Explicit Derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implicit Derivative\n",
    "When deriving implicitly, f.e $y^2 = x^2 + 1$ we can derive this with respect to $x$, but as we know $y$ is a function of the input $x$ we need to use the **Chain Rule** everytime we take the derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$. **\"Respect to x\"** simply means that we are applying the change to $x$ f.e $\\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}$ where h is the change and therefore $y$ is the resulting effect of applying that change to $x$. This is the reason in implicit derivatives, we can derive $x$ explicitly but not $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, $y^2$ is actually a set of two functions $f(g(x))$ as y itself is a function of x and then we have the outer function exponent $f(y) = y^2$ which means what we are really taking the derivative of on the left side is both the inner function of $y = g(x)$ and the outer $f(y) = y^2$. Easy example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y^2 = x^2 + 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "$2y\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^2)Â $ *Chain Rule on the left side*\n",
    "\n",
    "$2yy^\\prime = 2x$\n",
    "\n",
    "$y^\\prime = \\frac{x}{y}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This basically creates a differential equation, but we already know $y$ therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y = \\sqrt{x^2 + 1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$y^\\prime = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "And as an exercise, take the derivative of $y$ directly after taking the square root of both sides and you will end up with the same answer."
