    "\n",
    "Many formulas for area and volume we learn as childrens or teenagers can be derived directly from calculus using integrals. The reason for this is of course pretty self-explanatory, but calculus gives us the tool to basically calculate the area and volume of stuff as long as we have a function to derive it from. The elegant part of this approach is that we can actually find the **exact** formulas by first imagining how integrate an object and it's extremely beautiful. This will be a collection of some of those formulas.\n"
